This is a university project that was a part of the Mars Rover Team for the European Rover Challenge 2020. The goal was to use the ZED camera to attain the depth of the image and publish the information on a ROS node, which communicates with other components of the Robots using ROS which are not included in this project. In combination with the object detection module, the depth of the detected object is determined.
