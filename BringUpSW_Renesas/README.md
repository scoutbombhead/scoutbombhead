This project was a part of my Bachelorthesis. The topic was to create a so called "Bring Up Software" for a Renesas R-Car M3N graphic controller. It comprises of a Software to initialize and validate some low-level functionalities of the microcontroller which had a Unix-based OS running on it. The HMI of this Software was based on Python, the rest of the Software was written in C. 
This project was done in cooperation with Continental AG in Babenhausen, Germany. For legal reasons, I haven't included the written documentation in the repository.
